## 1. Introduction

In engineering-stage systems, decision-related problems are often discussed
as if they were immediately observable or evaluable.
In practice, many such problems cannot be surfaced, compared, or even named.

This document addresses a prerequisite question:

> **Under what conditions can a decision-related problem be said to exist
> as a discussable object at all?**

Before risk, before analysis, and before governance interpretation,
there must exist a minimal set of conceptual anchors
that allow a problem to manifest.

This version introduces those anchors.

---

## 2. Decision (Conceptual Definition)

A **Decision** is not treated as an explicit action, command, or event.

Within this framework, a decision is defined as:

> A latent structural commitment that enables, constrains,
> or excludes a range of possible execution effects.

Key clarifications:

- A decision may exist without being named.
- A decision may be enacted through defaults, tools, configurations, or agents.
- The presence of an outcome does not imply the presence of a decision.

This definition deliberately avoids intent, correctness, or responsibility.

---

## 3. Decision Authority

**Decision Authority** refers to the structural capacity
by which a system, agent, or configuration
is able to produce effects that would normally require deliberate choice.

Authority in this document is:

- Structural, not normative
- Enabling, not evaluative
- Observable only through its effects

Authority legitimacy or appropriateness is out of scope.

---

## 4. Decision Authority Effect (DAE)

**Decision Authority Effect (DAE)** denotes the observable effect surface
enabled by a given authority configuration.

DAE is defined as:

> The set of execution effects that become possible or reachable
> due to an authority configuration,
> regardless of whether a decision was explicitly represented.

Boundaries:

- DAE is not a decision.
- DAE is not a judgment.
- DAE does not imply correctness or risk.

DAE provides the minimal observable substrate
for any subsequent discussion of decisions.

---

## 5. Over Outcome

**Over Outcome** describes an observable condition
in which execution effects exceed what was initially expected or assumed.

Over Outcome:

- Is a descriptive signal, not a diagnosis
- Does not imply error, failure, or risk
- Does not guarantee the presence of a decision problem

Over Outcome merely indicates that
**something exceeded an assumed boundary**,
not that the boundary itself was defined.

---

## 6. Anchoring Preconditions

Many decision-related problems cannot be surfaced or estimated
because the conditions required to anchor them are absent.

This document defines **Anchoring Preconditions**
as the minimal conceptual requirements
for a decision-related issue to become discussable.

Anchoring Preconditions are not analysis steps.
They are **existence conditions**.

---

### 6.1 Scope Anchoring

A problem cannot be surfaced
if there is no declared or assumed scope.

Scope anchoring minimally requires:

- An identifiable input scope
- An identifiable output or effect scope

Without scope anchoring,
there is no reference against which “over” or “outside” can be stated.

---

### 6.2 Authority Anchoring

A problem cannot be attributed
if authority is not conceptually anchored.

Authority anchoring minimally requires:

- Some notion of who or what is structurally able to act
- Even if that notion is implicit or default-based

Without authority anchoring,
effects may exist, but responsibility cannot even be discussed.

---

### 6.3 Decision Anchoring

A problem cannot be framed as decision-related
if the existence of a decision is not conceptually admissible.

Decision anchoring minimally requires:

- Acceptance that effects may originate from latent decisions
- Even if no explicit decision record exists

Without decision anchoring,
effects are treated as environmental noise or system behavior.

---

### 6.4 Effect Anchoring

A problem cannot be estimated
if effects are not distinguishable.

Effect anchoring minimally requires:

- Observable differences, changes, or reachable actions
- Regardless of their perceived importance

Without effect anchoring,
no comparison, estimation, or discussion is possible.

---

## 7. Decision Risk (Conceptual Category)

**Decision Risk** describes a class of governance-relevant conditions
in which decision-related structures introduce uncertainty,
exposure, or loss of accountability.

In this document:

- Decision Risk is not quantified
- Decision Risk is not evaluated
- Decision Risk is not mitigated

Decision Risk is only **named**,
and only becomes meaningful
when anchoring preconditions are satisfied.

---

## 8. Decision Risk Categories (Terminology)

The following categories describe *types of decision-related risk conditions*.
They apply **only after anchoring preconditions are met**.

---

### DR-V — Decision Vacancy

A condition in which:

- Decision Authority Effects are observable
- No attributable decision structure can be identified

Decision Vacancy cannot be asserted
if authority or decision anchoring is absent.

---

### DR-O — Over Decision Risk

A condition in which:

- Decisions are conceptually identifiable
- Authority effects extend broadly or persistently

Over Decision Risk presupposes scope anchoring.
Without scope, “over” has no meaning.

---

### DR-I — Indeterminate Decision Risk

A condition in which:

- Authority effects are observable
- Anchoring is partial or unstable
- Available information does not support further distinction

Indeterminacy here reflects anchoring insufficiency,
not analytical failure.

---

## 9. Normal Decision (Baseline Concept)

A **Normal Decision** condition exists when:

- Anchoring preconditions are satisfied
- Decisions are conceptually identifiable
- Authority effects are bounded and explainable

Normality here is descriptive,
not normative or optimal.

---

## 10. Relationship to Governance

This document does not perform governance evaluation.

Instead, it clarifies **when governance discussion becomes possible at all**.

Without anchoring preconditions:

- Risk cannot be estimated
- Responsibility cannot be discussed
- Governance language becomes speculative

Anchoring precedes governance.

---

## 11. Conclusion

This version introduces anchoring preconditions
as a conceptual layer preceding decision analysis and risk interpretation.

By distinguishing between:
- absence of anchors
- indeterminate conditions
- named risk categories

this document prevents premature analysis
and avoids false precision in governance discussions.

---

> **A problem that cannot be anchored cannot be analyzed.  
> A problem that cannot be analyzed cannot be governed.**

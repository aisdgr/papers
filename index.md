**Domain Focus**  
Sub-domain of AI Governance centered on **development-stage decision behavior**.  
- **Focus:** Governs how decision behaviors are formed during engineering activities.  
- **Scope:** **Development-stage (design-time / ex-ante)** structural governance.  
- **Core Paradigm:** **EDBG** – Engineering Decision Behavior Governance.  
- **Core Realization Framework:** **EDBF** – Engineering Decision Behavior Framework.

## EDBG: Engineering Decision Behavior Governance
> A theoretical governance framework that shifts the focus from static output auditing to the dynamic guidance and sovereign control of AI-driven "decision behaviors" within engineering evolutions.

## Governance

---

## EDBF: Engineering Decision Behavior Framework
> Provides engineering-level structures and methods to form, observe, and carry decision behaviors so they can be implemented and analyzed.

---

## Definitions

### Decision Phenomenon Definitions
> Describe observable decision behavior phenomena in engineering practice as the basis for problem identification and theoretical analysis.

### Decision Scope Definitions
> Presents factors that influence decision behavior during the development stage.

---

## Decision Lifecycle Phases
> Characterize the lifecycle stages through which decision behaviors are formed, enacted, and generate effects, supporting analysis, governance, and engineering alignment.

### Before Decision Behavior Occurs

### During Decision Behavior Formation

### After Decision Behavior Occurs

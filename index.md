# Research Paper Index

This index provides a **structural overview** of all research papers
maintained in this repository.

Paper status is determined by **directory placement**.
This file records only factual information:
location, lifecycle state, and public availability.

For status semantics, see `STATUS.md`.

## Notes

- Content changes do not require updates to this index.
- This index is updated only when a paper is:
  - added
  - moved between lifecycle states
  - made publicly accessible

This file serves as the **single source of truth** for paper status.

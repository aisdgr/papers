# Papers

This repository is a working collection of research drafts and manuscripts
exploring how software engineering must adapt to AI-assisted development,
and what this implies for making AI governance practically realizable.

The contents span multiple stages of maturity, including early conceptual drafts,
in-progress papers, and submitted or preprint manuscripts.
Not all documents represent finalized positions.

## Scope

This repository focuses on **software engineering as the primary locus of inquiry**.
Discussions of AI governance appear only insofar as they emerge from
engineering structures, development practices, and system-level constraints.

The emphasis is on the **development phase**, rather than deployment-time
policy, compliance, or institutional governance.

## Repository Structure

- `drafts/`  
  Early concepts, exploratory arguments, and incomplete manuscripts.

- `in-progress/`  
  Actively developed papers with a defined direction, but not yet submitted.

- `submitted/`  
  Manuscripts that have been submitted to conferences, journals, or archives.

- `preprints/`  
  Publicly available preprints (e.g., arXiv) corresponding to submitted work.

- `index.md`  
  A chronological and thematic index of all papers in this repository.

## Reading Guide

If you are new to this repository:

1. Start with `index.md` to understand the landscape and maturity of the papers.
2. Read preprints if you are looking for stable reference points.
3. Consult drafts only if you are interested in ideas under active formation.

## Relationship to Other Repositories

This repository is part of a broader research workspace that also includes:

- conceptual and narrative exploration (blogs)
- formalized structures and constraint definitions (schemas)

Each repository is separated by **artifact type**, not by research domain.

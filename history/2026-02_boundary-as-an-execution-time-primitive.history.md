# 2026-02_boundary-as-an-execution-time-primitive — Version History

This document records the conceptual and structural evolution of this paper.

---

## 0.1 – Initial Observation
- Identified loss of control in AI-assisted development.
- Early intuition that “governance fails before runtime.”

## 0.2 – Boundary Hypothesis
- Introduced boundary as prerequisite for governance.
- Early linkage to drift and non-reproducibility.

## 0.3 – Scope and Constraint Separation
- Distinguished visible scope from behavioral constraint.
- Identified insufficiency of scope-only specifications.

## 0.4 – Engineering Scenarios
- Introduced prompt-only, prompt+SDD, prompt+SDD+constraint scenarios.
- Demonstrated predictable insecure outcomes.

## 0.5 – Formalization
- Defined boundary as execution-time construct.
- Introduced mathematical formulation and epistemic drift argument.

## 0.6 – Model vs. Task Boundary Distinction
- Identified category error between training-time alignment and execution-time boundary.
- Clarified non-inheritance of task boundaries.

## 0.7 – Structural Correction
- Restored drift as epistemic illusion.
- Unified engineering scenarios.
- Added boundary evidence schema.

## 1.0 – Final Conceptual Anchor
- Explicitly stated non-closure of boundary primitives.
- Positioned visible scope and constraints as minimal decidable foundation.
- Finalized paper as conceptual anchor for execution-time governance research.

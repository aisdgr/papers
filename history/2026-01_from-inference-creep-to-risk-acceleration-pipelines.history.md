# From Inference Creep to Risk Acceleration Pipelines — Version History

This history documents the conceptual evolution of the paper that introduces
**Inference Creep** as a structural governance risk in AI-assisted development
and traces its progression into **Risk Acceleration Pipelines**. The paper
focuses on problem definition, risk observability, and engineering-detectable
criteria, rather than proposing governance frameworks or enforcement solutions.

---

## v0.1 — Phenomenon Declaration

**Status:** Exploratory / Naming Phase

### Purpose
- Establish **Inference Creep** as a named phenomenon in AI-assisted software
  development.
- Describe how incremental, probabilistic expansion of inferred intent can
  exceed original human authorization without explicit decision points.

### Key Contributions
- Introduced **Inference Creep** as distinct from feature creep, scope drift,
  or requirement changes.
- Identified inference expansion as a *decision behavior* problem rather than
  a model hallucination issue.
- Positioned the phenomenon within AI-assisted SDLC contexts.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No governance framework or control proposal.
- No mitigation strategy or tooling design.
- No empirical benchmarking.

### Rationale
v0.1 functions as a **phenomenon boundary document**, defining what Inference
Creep is and why it cannot be explained by existing software engineering
terminology.

## v0.2 — Structural Risk Framing

**Status:** Risk Conceptualization Phase

### Purpose
- Connect Inference Creep to systemic engineering risk rather than isolated
  model behavior.
- Explain why accumulated inference expansion introduces delayed but amplified
  organizational risk.

### Key Contributions
- Introduced the concept of **deferred risk accumulation** driven by repeated
  inference without renewed authorization.
- Distinguished local correctness from global risk exposure.
- Framed productivity gains as a **measurement illusion** masking latent risk.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No runtime monitoring discussion.
- No safety alignment or model-centric analysis.

### Rationale
v0.2 elevates Inference Creep from an anecdotal phenomenon to a structural
risk pattern.

## v0.3 — Risk Acceleration Pipeline

**Status:** Systemic Pattern Definition Phase

### Purpose
- Describe how Inference Creep propagates through development workflows and
  becomes a self-reinforcing risk structure.

### Key Contributions
- Introduced **Risk Acceleration Pipelines** as organizational pathways where
  inference expansion, scale, and automation amplify downstream risk.
- Identified scale, iteration speed, and delegation depth as acceleration
  factors.
- Demonstrated how AI-assisted pipelines can convert small authorization gaps
  into systemic exposure.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No pipeline governance solution.
- No organizational policy recommendations.

### Rationale
v0.3 establishes the causal bridge between micro-level inference behavior and
macro-level risk accumulation.

## v0.4 — Engineering-Detectable Indicators

**Status:** Observability Phase

### Purpose
- Identify conditions under which Inference Creep and risk acceleration can be
  detected from engineering artifacts.

### Key Contributions
- Proposed **engineering-detectable criteria** for identifying Inference Creep,
  including:
  - absence of explicit decision renewal,
  - disproportionate output expansion,
  - traceability gaps between intent and artifacts.
- Shifted risk discussion from post-incident analysis to early detection.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No automated detection algorithms.
- No enforcement or blocking mechanisms.

### Rationale
v0.4 makes the phenomenon observable without prescribing intervention.

## v0.5 — Governance Interpretation

**Status:** Conceptual Integration Phase

### Purpose
- Position Inference Creep and Risk Acceleration Pipelines within the broader
  **Decision Behavior Governance** discourse.

### Key Contributions
- Framed Inference Creep as a **governance vacancy**, not a reasoning failure.
- Connected risk acceleration to absence of decision authorization boundaries.
- Clarified that governance failure precedes operational failure.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No governance framework definition.
- No decision constraint specification.

### Rationale
v0.5 integrates the phenomenon into a governance ontology without proposing
solutions.

## v0.6 — Scope Clarification & Non-Claims

**Status:** Scope Stabilization Phase

### Purpose
- Prevent misinterpretation of the paper as proposing mitigation techniques.
- Explicitly declare analytical boundaries.

### Key Contributions
- Added explicit **Non-Claims** section clarifying:
  - no solutions proposed,
  - no governance mechanisms defined,
  - no runtime control recommendations.
- Strengthened positioning as a problem-definition and risk-identification
  paper.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No case studies.
- No compliance mapping.

### Rationale
v0.6 locks the paper’s role as a diagnostic contribution.

## v0.7 — Language Refinement & Concept Alignment

**Status:** Conceptual Refinement Phase

### Purpose
- Improve terminological precision and internal consistency.

### Key Contributions
- Standardized terminology across:
  - inference,
  - authorization,
  - decision behavior,
  - risk acceleration.
- Removed ambiguous language implying remediation.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No structural reorganization.
- No new concepts introduced.

### Rationale
v0.7 ensures conceptual clarity and reviewer robustness.

---

## v0.8 — Boundary & Responsibility Emphasis

**Status:** Accountability Framing Phase

### Purpose
- Emphasize the implications of Inference Creep for responsibility and
  attribution.

### Key Contributions
- Clarified how inference-driven expansion undermines responsibility mapping.
- Connected risk acceleration to **unattributable decisions** and governance
  ambiguity.
- Reinforced distinction between execution correctness and authorization
  legitimacy.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No legal prescriptions.
- No compliance solutions.

### Rationale
v0.8 strengthens the paper’s relevance to governance and audit discourse.

---

## v0.9 — Structural Coherence & Cross-Paper Isolation

**Status:** Pre-Stabilization Phase

### Purpose
- Ensure the paper stands independently from adjacent DBG works.

### Key Contributions
- Removed overlaps with governance realization and standard-interpretation
  papers.
- Finalized narrative flow from phenomenon to systemic risk.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No expansion of scope.
- No response to specific reviewer feedback.

### Rationale
v0.9 prepares the manuscript for stable reference.

## v1.0 — Inference Creep as Governance Risk (Stable)

**Status:** Stable Conceptual Version

### Purpose
- Establish a stable, citable articulation of Inference Creep and Risk
  Acceleration Pipelines.

### Key Contributions
- Consolidated Inference Creep as a core concept in Decision Behavior Governance.
- Defined Risk Acceleration Pipelines as a structural consequence of unchecked
  inference expansion.
- Provided engineering-detectable criteria for early risk identification.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No governance framework.
- No mitigation or enforcement strategy.
- No arXiv-oriented positioning.

### Rationale
v1.0 represents the completed conceptual contribution: a problem-definition
and risk-structure paper that grounds later governance and standards-oriented
work without prescribing solutions.

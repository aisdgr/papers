# Ghost Intent — Version History

This document records the conceptual evolution of *Ghost Intent* as a
phenomenon-definition and governance-oriented manuscript.  
The history itself is treated as a supporting artifact for intent traceability,
scope control, and conceptual stabilization.

---

## v0.1 — Phenomenon Declaration  
**Status:** Exploratory / Naming Phase

### Purpose
- Establish *Ghost Intent* as a named phenomenon in GenAI-assisted SDLCs.
- Define the experiential and structural conditions under which engineering
  intent becomes unrecoverable despite the persistence of executable artifacts.
- Explicitly avoid proposing tools, workflows, or enforcement mechanisms.

### Key Contributions
- Introduced **Ghost Intent** as the experiential manifestation of
  **Authorless Traceability Collapse (ATC)**.
- Distinguished Ghost Intent from:
  - undocumented code,
  - legacy code,
  - and intentionally obfuscated or poorly maintained systems.
- Identified **Debug Cost Inversion** as a structural consequence rather than
  a productivity anomaly.
- Framed productivity gains as a **measurement illusion**, not a genuine
  capacity increase.
- Introduced the notion of **deferred and amplified risk**, emerging through:
  - scale-based expansion of generated artifacts,
  - iteration-based accumulation of misunderstanding.
- Extended risk discussion to include:
  - code deletion under absent intent,
  - external system integration without explicit boundary rationale.
- Clarified that the existence of design documentation (e.g., SDD) does not
  eliminate Ghost Intent due to decision–artifact decoupling and document drift.

### Deliberate Non-Goals
- No solution design or tooling recommendations.
- No enforcement or runtime governance mechanisms.
- No empirical benchmarking or controlled experiments.
- No SDLC replacement proposal.

### Rationale
v0.1 functions as a **phenomenon boundary document**: it defines *what Ghost
Intent is* and *why existing SDLC assumptions fail*, without constraining future
formalization paths.

---

## v0.2 — Structural & Observability Extension  
**Status:** Conceptual Stabilization (Additive Only)

### Change Policy
- Additive only.
- No modification or removal of v0.1 content.
- All new sections introduced as structural extensions.

### New Contributions

1. **Minimal Formalization**
   - Introduced a minimal logical formulation of intent loss:
     distinguishing preserved artifacts from absent decision provenance.
   - Explicitly avoided prescriptive models or instrumentation assumptions.

2. **Intent Anchor**
   - Defined *Intent Anchor* as a structural reference binding decisions to
     navigable coordinates within software artifacts.
   - Distinguished anchoring from documentation or comments.

3. **Observability Without Instrumentation**
   - Established Ghost Intent as observable only through indirect absence
     patterns rather than explicit signals.
   - Positioned observability as *recognition*, not reconstruction.

4. **SDLC Assumption Failure Mapping**
   - Systematically mapped how traditional SDLC assumptions fail under
     GenAI-assisted, review-centric development.
   - Framed Ghost Intent as assumption invalidation rather than process error.

5. **Multi-Dimensional Risk Classification**
   - Introduced five orthogonal risk dimensions:
     - Artifact Alignment
     - SDLC Lifecycle
     - Amplification Mechanism
     - Impact Scope
     - Cognitive & Decision
   - Avoided mitigation strategies or prioritization schemes.

### Explicit Non-Goals
- No mitigation frameworks.
- No detection algorithms.
- No metrics or KPIs.
- No governance enforcement mechanisms.

### Purpose
v0.2 elevates Ghost Intent from a named phenomenon to a **structurally analyzable
condition**, preparing the ground for governance-oriented discussion without
committing to solutions.

---

## v0.3 — Governance Alignment & Intertextual Stabilization  
**Status:** Preprint-Ready / Scope-Sealed

### Change Policy
- **No new conceptual primitives introduced.**
- Refinement, alignment, and stabilization only.
- Scope explicitly sealed after this version.

### Key Advances

1. **Cross-Paper Terminology Alignment**
   - Aligned Ghost Intent with related concepts from parallel work:
     - *Inference Creep*
     - *Decision Vacancy*
     - *Ghost Code* (as a DevOps-specific manifestation)
   - Clarified Ghost Intent as the **experiential signal**, not the causal root.

2. **Formal Risk Framing for Governance Contexts**
   - Reframed Ghost Intent explicitly as a **first-order governance risk**.
   - Positioned decision provenance loss as a structural liability rather than
     a tooling or skill deficit.

3. **Risk Classification Consolidation**
   - Introduced a summarized risk table suitable for SSRN and governance readers.
   - Emphasized severity indicators and systemic impact over engineering detail.

4. **Decision-Centric SDLC Reorientation**
   - Clarified that traditional SDLCs treat code as the primary artifact.
   - Positioned Ghost Intent as evidence that **decision provenance must be
     elevated to first-class artifact status**.

5. **Intertextual Reference Stabilization**
   - Standardized self-references to related manuscripts (Tsai, 2026).
   - Distinguished this paper’s scope from solution-oriented frameworks
     (e.g., EDBF, DBG), reserving them for future work.

6. **SSRN-Oriented Rhetorical Refinement**
   - Adjusted language to emphasize:
     - governance risk,
     - organizational accountability,
     - asset epistemology.
   - Avoided technical over-specification inappropriate for SSRN audiences.

### Explicit Non-Goals (Reaffirmed)
- No solution proposals.
- No pipeline or tool architecture.
- No enforcement or compliance mechanism design.
- No empirical validation claims.

### Rationale
v0.3 serves as the **scope-sealing version** of *Ghost Intent*.  
After this point, the manuscript enters a refinement-only phase focused on
clarity, citation completeness, and rhetorical precision—without conceptual
expansion.

## Versioning Notes

- Future versions (if any) will be editorial or publication-format driven.
- Conceptual extensions will occur in **separate manuscripts**, not revisions
  of this document.
- This history file is maintained as an explicit countermeasure against
  untracked conceptual drift.

## v0.3 (Stabilized) — Current Working Version

**Status:** Draft (Stabilized, SSRN-Ready)  
**Date:** February 2026  

This version retains **all content and structure of v0.3**, with only the
following **permitted, non-expansive changes** applied:

### Allowed Changes (Strictly Additive / Normalizing)

1. **Reference Expansion**
   - Added six additional references (2025–2026) covering:
     - Empirical studies on GenAI productivity paradox and verification overhead.
     - Provenance and explainability gaps in generated artifacts.
     - GenAI-specific governance and risk frameworks (NIST AI 600-1, OECD).
     - Long-term maintenance outcomes of AI-generated code.
   - No references removed.
   - Citation ordering normalized (self-citation first, then external sources).

2. **AI Assistance Disclosure**
   - Added an explicit disclosure section stating:
     - AI tools were used for language refinement only.
     - All conceptual frameworks, definitions, and analysis remain human-authored.
   - Included to align with emerging SSRN and journal transparency expectations.

3. **Terminology Normalization**
   - Unified wording without altering meaning or structure:
     - “functional” → “behaviorally coherent”
     - “reverse engineering” → “interpretive archaeology”
     - “resists rational reconstruction” → “epistemically opaque”
   - No sentences removed; no arguments reframed.

### Explicit Non-Changes

- No new sections added.
- No sections reordered.
- No analytical depth reduced.
- No new formulas, variables, or theoretical axes introduced.
- No migration of material from companion papers (Inference Creep, Boundary).

This stabilized v0.3 is the **canonical version for SSRN submission**.

## Versioning Policy Going Forward

- v0.3 is the final scope-bearing version.
- Any future revisions (e.g., journal resubmission) will be:
  - Editorial only, or
  - Clearly versioned as venue-specific adaptations.
- No expansion of conceptual scope will occur within this manuscript.

# Decision Analysis — Version History

This document records the conceptual evolution of the *Decision Analysis* line.
Each version intentionally stabilizes a specific layer of reasoning.
Later versions do not invalidate earlier ones; they add constraints
to prevent analytical and governance misclassification.

## v0.10 — Initial Consolidation (Unreleased Draft)

**Status:** internal working draft  
**Role:** concept aggregation

### Characteristics
- Mixed terminology from *Decision Risk* and *Decision Analysis*
- Authority, decision, effect, and risk concepts not yet separated
- Analysis and governance language partially interleaved

### Limitations Identified
- Authority implicitly treated as a primary analytical construct
- Risk language introduced before analytical preconditions were clarified
- No clear boundary between:
  - analysis result
  - governance interpretation
  - pre-analytical absence

This version was never intended for publication.

## v0.11 — Terminology Stabilization (Semantic Baseline)

**Status:** semantic baseline  
**Role:** terminology and conceptual definitions only

### Key Contributions
- Stabilized core terms:
  - Decision (latent structural commitment)
  - Effect (observable manifestation)
  - Over Outcome
  - Decision Risk (conceptual category)
- Explicitly excluded:
  - decision elements
  - analytical procedures
  - formulas
  - governance judgments
- Established DR categories as **semantic classifications**, not analytical outputs:
  - DR-N (implicit baseline)
  - DR-O
  - DR-V
  - DR-I

### Explicit Non-Goals
- No analysis workflow
- No determinability criteria
- No notion of observability or anchoring

### Rationale
v0.11 fixed *what the words mean*,
but not *when those words are applicable*.

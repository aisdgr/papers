# Decision Analysis — Version History

This document records the conceptual evolution of the *Decision Analysis* line.
Each version intentionally stabilizes a specific layer of reasoning.
Later versions do not invalidate earlier ones; they add constraints
to prevent analytical and governance misclassification.

## v0.10 — Initial Consolidation (Unreleased Draft)

**Status:** internal working draft  
**Role:** concept aggregation

### Characteristics
- Mixed terminology from *Decision Risk* and *Decision Analysis*
- Authority, decision, effect, and risk concepts not yet separated
- Analysis and governance language partially interleaved

### Limitations Identified
- Authority implicitly treated as a primary analytical construct
- Risk language introduced before analytical preconditions were clarified
- No clear boundary between:
  - analysis result
  - governance interpretation
  - pre-analytical absence

This version was never intended for publication.
